# Plotting Geometric random variables

Now that you can write a function to generate geometric random varibles lets make a scatter plot for this type of random variable.  For this exercise you will need to generate 100 geometric random variables and draw a graph showing the 
values of all these random variables.

To complete this exercise you will need to:  

- Write a function called `geometric` that takes  `p` (the probability of success) as an argument using what you learned in the previous exercise.

- Use this function and what you know about loops, lists and plotting to make a scatter plot showing 100 geometric random variables.  The x-coordinates of the points in your plot should be 1, 2, 3 etc and the y-coordinates should be the values of 100 geometric random variables that have the p parameter set to the global variable `prob`.  The x-axis label of the graph should be "Index" and the y-axis label should be "random variable".
